## Pre-Commit Verification & Security Checklist

Before opening a Pull Request, verify your changes against our Zero-Trust standards:

### 1. Bytecode Compilation
Ensure all modified Python modules compile cleanly with zero syntax warnings:
```bash
python -m py_compile main.py
python -m py_compile src/**/*.py
```

### 2. Local SAST Security Audit
Run Bandit to check for common Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE):
```bash
bandit -r src/ main.py -ll
```

### 3. Secret Leak Prevention
- Never commit active API keys, Discord webhooks, Telegram bot tokens, or private `.pem` keys.
- Store test credentials exclusively in `.env` (which is gitignored).

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Create a focused feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-capability
   ```
2. Adhere to Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `sec:`, `docs:`, `ci:`).
3. If pair programming or using AI-assisted tooling (e.g. Claude Code), include the official co-authorship trailer:
   ```text
   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
4. Open your Pull Request and ensure the automated Sentinel CI pipeline passes.
